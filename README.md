## 📊 Project Philosophy

Each project follows a structured framework:

1. Define the business problem  
2. Explore and clean the data  
3. Perform exploratory analysis  
4. Build analytical or ML models  
5. Evaluate performance  
6. Generate business insights  

The goal is to think like an analyst, not just code like a programmer.
